Absurdle is a variation of the popular game Wordle, where the player tries to guess a five letter English
word and is given feedback in the form of colored tiles indicating correct or incorrect letter placement.
The difference is that Absurdle tries to prolong the game by having multiple words that can be the solution
word instead of picking one in the beginning. This Java program utilizes sets and maps to create and manipulate
nested collections of data. To run the program, compile the AbsurdleManager class and run AbsurdleMain.
